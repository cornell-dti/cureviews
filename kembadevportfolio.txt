So far still working on the Recommendations for CUReviews

As of right now, loaded all courses from FA23 into clusters
Totaling 49 total clusters 

Currently we have some outliers in the clusters, so some clusters may only have a few classes in them. 
In order to fix this issue im looking to merge cluster that dont meet the length requirement, for each thing inside the cluster, we find another cluster that they are most similar too, and that is its new home.

Current Goal:
Make each cluster be of 50 classes at the lowest
