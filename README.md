## About

A web app for Cornell students to read and write reviews for Cornell classes, allowing a common platform for students to get advice and suggestions for picking classes. In other words, a "rate my Cornell classes".

## Getting Started

Create an .env file in the `server/` folder with content:

```bash
MONGODB_URL=[SECRET_URL_ASK_TEAM_MEMBER_FOR_IT]
```

**You will probably use the address of the staging server.** If, for some reason you want to have a local db (E.g. you're making some changes to the db structure, and don't want to accidently trash the staging db), the following works:

<details><summary>Running using local mongodb server</summary>
<p>

Option 1:

Previously, you would start a server like so:

```bash
MONGODB_URL='mongodb://foo' yarn workspace server start
```

There is also something called "fallback mode", which you can trigger by starting the server with the ALLOW_LOCAL env variable set to 1, and **without** setting MONGODB_URL. Fallback mode automatically configures a blank mongodb for use in the application, and then scrapes some data from Cornell's endpoint for you to test. There will not be any reviews by default.

```bash
ALLOW_LOCAL=1 yarn workspace server start
```

Option 2:

<details><summary>If you really, really do want to use a local Mongo instance using mongod (not recommended), this might work: </summary>

You need the mongodb database tools and server installed. They are available [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/) and [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community). If, for some reason, you want to use the tools on a linux box, you will probably have to build them from source [here](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-tools).

```bash
mkdir mongo # create a directory for mongo to dump its files in
mongod --dbpath mongo/ --port 3001 # launch the mongo server on localhost:3001
```

Set your `MONGODB_URL` to `mongodb://localhost:3001`

You will probably want to restore some collections from a bson, in which case you should, in a new terminal:

```bash
mongorestore -h 127.0.0.1 --port 3001 -d test /path/to/your/bson.bson --drop
```

You will probably need to run this for the `classes`, `subjects` and `reviews` collections (Perhaps also `students`). Ask a team member for the bsons if you need them. If this errors, it might be because the `-d test` specifies the wrong database name (`test`), in which case you should figure out your db name, and replace `-d test` with `-d dbname`. Note that it **won't** error on the command, the only evidence of an error is that none of collections will be show up on the site (i.e. no classes visible).

Now that you have the database configured, make sure you have [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) installed.

```bash
yarn
yarn workspace server start # start server
yarn workspace client start # start client
```

You can access the app at [http://localhost:3000].

If you need features which use admin access, you need to create an entry in the `students` collection which has you flagged as an admin user. We should have done this when you joined the team.

## Dependencies & Libraries

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)** v10 - **Node.js provides the basis for our server. It handles external connects and gives us access to an vast array of useful packages via Node Package Manager (NPM)**
- **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)** v4.17.1 - **The package for running the web server.**
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** v16.13.1 - **We use React to help us create a component-based site. Using components allow us to re-use code more efficiently and modify their implementation more quickly**
- **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** v3.3.7 - **Allows us to quickly define our front end componentsâ€™ display.**
